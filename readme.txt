about me
Hello!, As a programmer, I specialized in the Web Development area. For the last 3 years, I have been developing Web applications using React.js, Laravel, Angular, Express, Django, and other web frameworks.Coding is my passion. One of the best parts of being a programmer is creating something that didn't exist before. And then you get control over an application, website, or whatever your creation is!
